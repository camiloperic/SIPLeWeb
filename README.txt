SInPLes stands for Sistema de Iniciativa Popular Legislativa, in english it would be Legislative Popular Iniciative System. Legislative Popular Iniciative is a democratic tool granted in Brazilian Constitution, a form of political popular participation where anyone can write a propousal for a new law.
